# Normalization-Standardization
Statistical Basic Concept

What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of scaling down data(in simple words). Usually while normalizing we change the scale of the data to fall between 0â€“1.


Normalized Data Vs Standardized Data:

1. Normalization is used when the data doesn't have Gaussian distribution whereas Standardization is used on data having Gaussian (or Normal) distribution.
2. Normalization scales in a range of [0,1] or [-1,1]. Standardization is not bounded by range.
3. Normalization is highly affected by outliers. Standardization is slightly affected by outliers.
4. Normalization is considered when the algorithms do not make assumptions about the data distribution. Standardization is used when algorithms make assumptions about the data distribution.
